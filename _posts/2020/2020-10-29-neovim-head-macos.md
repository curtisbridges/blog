Speaking of the [XDG config directories](xdg-directories/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org) does not support XDG so I looked for alternative implementations and saw there has been a ground swell in recent years to [neovim](https://neovim.io) which does as well as other nice features. I decided to give it a try.
